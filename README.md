# Parallelized K-means Clustering Algorithm <br>(using C Pthreads and OpenMP API for C)
1. This is a parallelized implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm using Pthreads and OpenMP in C. <br>
2. The project contains the source files, scripts to compile and run, datasets generation files, speedup computation scripts and speedup visualisation scripts (using matplotlib) <br>
3. A detailed discussion on the parallelization strategy is present in a contained report.<br>
4. The report also contains the observed performance of the project on different datasets.<br>
5. The speedup and efficiency plots obtained are in accordance with Amdahl's speedup law.
