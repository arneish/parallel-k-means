# Parallelized K-means Clustering Algorithm <br>(using C Pthreads and OpenMP API for C)
This is a parallelized implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm using C Pthreads and OpenMP. <br>
The project contains the source files, scripts to compile and run, datasets generation files, speedup computation scripts and speedup visualisation scripts (using matplotlib) <br>
A detailed discussion on the parallelization strategy is present in a contained report.<br>The report also contains the observed performance of the project on different datasets.<br>The speedup and efficiency plots obtained are in accordance with Amdahl's speedup law.
